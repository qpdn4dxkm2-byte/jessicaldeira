        One problem that drove me was the closure of the future. To make that point I want everyone here to imagine the
        worst mistake you have ever made. Don't share it. Now imagine everything you've learned from that mistake, how
        you've changed your thinking, how you've changed your life or how you aspire to change your life in response to
        that mistake. Now imagine a world in which you could never learn from that mistake, because that mistake has
        become your ground truth. And what this means is that everything in the future is validated as true or correct
        based on whether it matches that past. And it's that loss of learning in ways that the future has been reduced
        to the past that we're now facing. <br>
